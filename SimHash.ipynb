    "\n",
    "Basically, Simhashing is compressing hash values in the document into one hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compressing takes two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, summing up the values of each positions in generated hashes.\n",
    "Second, converting the summed up value into binary hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "First part, for each binary digits of hashes generated by hashing each alphabet, or each word,\n",
    "we add 1 for the position if the digit is 1, subtract 1 for the position if the digit is 0.\n",
    "This allows us to keep the information of 0, instead of discarding it if we chose to add up the digit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if(hash(word)[pos] == 1): simhash[pos] += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if(hash(word)[pos] == 0): simhash[pos] -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we replace simhash digit with 1 if the position holds 0 or higher value, and 0 if the position holds negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if(simhash[pos] >= 0): simhash[pos] = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if(simhash[pos] < 0: simhash[pos] = 0\n"

    "Three advanced implements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a method to generate unique values for words (i.e. Using other hashing methods):\n",
    "    Using plain ASCII code values for simhashing gives the same value for contents having same alphabet, but in different sequence. This leads to false positives. By applying simple hashing methods, we could avoid this.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Using fixed, and LONG hash lengths:\n",
    "    If the hash codes generated for words are in different lengths, these hashes will need to be filled up with either 0s or 1s, that doesn't convey any information. These could lead to false positives.\n",
    "    Another problem that occurs by using plain ASCII code values for simhashing is that final hash results in very short representation that could easily collide with very different contents. By using hash methods that could provide long representations(i.e. MD5 hashing algorithm will give 128 bits of data, which decreases the chance of false positives)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Weighing the words according to the value of meaning they convey.\n",
    "    Consider sentences like 'White Cat is up in the green tree', and 'The cat in green tree is white', 'White tie is up in the green dresser'. First two sentences mean the exact same thing, whereas the last sentence is talking about something completely different. However, because of the words used in the sentences are more similar between the first and last sentences than the first and second, simhash will consider first and last sentence closer. To take more consideration on the context, we could weigh the words. Words like 'a', 'the', 'up', and 'in' doesn't really convey much context than the words like 'cat', 'tie', 'tree', and 'dresser' in the example sentences. By applying weights of 1 for 'a' and 'the, 2 for 'in' and 'up', and 4 or 5 for the nouns, we could get more contextual similarity distance between these sentences."
